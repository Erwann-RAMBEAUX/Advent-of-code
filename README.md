This repository contains my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) programming challenges, written in Go (Golang).

## 🎄 About Advent of Code

Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual event featuring a series of daily algorithmic puzzles released every day from December 1st to the 25th. It's a fun and popular way to sharpen programming and problem-solving skills.

This project documents my journey through the 2024 challenges, implemented in Go.

## 🛠️ Technology Used

* **Language:** Go (Golang)
* **Go Version:** 1.23.3

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these solutions, you must have the Go toolchain installed on your machine.
* You can download and install Go from the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Erwann-RAMBEAUX/Advent-of-code.git
    cd Advent-of-code
    ```

### Running a Solution

The solutions are organized into directories by year and day (e.g., `2024/j1/`).

To execute the solution for a specific day, use the `go run` command, replacing `j` with the appropriate day (e.g., `j1`, `j12`):

```bash
# Example for running Day 1
go run 2024/j1/j1.go
